End to End tests using Selenium Webdriver

You can use Browserstack also.

Notes: 
1. To use browserstack, you need to add your user and key to the capabilites.js file.
2. The log tests currently run just on browserstack platform (you can try to solve the issue yourself).
3. If youare not testing your network data, you don't need the proxy.
4. When using browserstack, you will need to run this project form webserver that will be your proxy, and set the ip and port acordenly.

I hope the above is useful to you,
